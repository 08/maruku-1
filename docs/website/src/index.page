__Authors__: Maruku has been developed so far by [Andrea Censi].
Contributors are most welcome!

__The name of the game__: Maruku is the [romaji] transliteration of 
the [katakana] transliteration
of "Mark", the first word in Markdown. I chose this name because Ruby 
is Japanese, and also the sillable "ru" appears in Maruku.
