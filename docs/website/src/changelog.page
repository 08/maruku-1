#### In the queue (TODO)  ####

*	Write documentation for extensions.
*	Bugs:
	
	*	See reported bugs in the [rubyforge tracker]().
	*	[not sure of this](http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=11448&group_id=2795&atid=10738), fix would be a quick hack.
	*	Fix bug with acronyms (found by Aggelos)

*	Features:

	*	Implement references (requested Jacques Distler)
	*	Implement templating system for command-line `maruku`.

#### Changes in the development version (**not released yet**)  ####     {#last}

#### Changes in 0.6 (May 2009) ####     {#stable}

*   Ruby 1.9 fixes by Nathan Weizenbaum.

*   Allows space in link ref ids (patch by Damir Zekic)

*	Better regexps for DIV frames (patch by Alexandr Mankuta)

*	Now the DIV syntax is activated by default.

*	Merged back changes by Jacques Distler for theorems support.

*	New feature, requested by Jeff Barczewski

	> It seems like a good fit to extend the Maruku meta data features to support setting things like this in a standard way.
	>
	>	<meta name="author" content="John Doe"/>
	>	<meta name="description" content="This is my page description."/>
	>	<meta name="revised" content="Hege Refsnes, 6/10/99" />
	>
	> One could support things directly like
	>
	> 	Author: John Doe
	> 	Description: This is my page description.
	> 	Revised: Hege Refsnes, 6/10/99
	>
	> of if you want to make all the meta tags generic you could do
	> 
	> 	Meta-Author: John Doe
	> 	Meta-Description: This is my page description.
	>
	> Where `Meta-*` would always create a `<meta name="foo" content="bar"/>`

*	Merged back changes by [Ari Stern](http://www.acm.caltech.edu/~astern) for equation-to-PNG 
	support in Instiki.

*	Bugs:

	* Export to s5 now uses `html` suffix.
	
	* Fixed [this bug](http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?func=detail&atid=10735&aid=20010&group_id=2795): now if there is an underscore in a world, then emphasis is not triggered. For example, `mod_ruby  mod\_ruby`
	yields "mod\_ruby  mod\_ruby".
	
#### Changes in 0.5.9 (June 2008) ####     {#stable}

*	Features:

	*	Implemented [DIV syntax](div.html) (Jacques Distler)
	*	Quieter operations for command-line `maruku`.

*	Fixed bugs:

	*	Incorrect handling of malformed Markdown (`![alt][` with no closing bracket)
	*	(Markdown Extra) Aligned behaviour of footnotes references to PHP Markdown Extra.
	*	(Demetrios Kyriakis) Command line option "--version" now shows Maruku version.
	*   Maruku did not allow abbreviation definitions. 
	
#### Changes in 0.5.8 (February 2008) ####     

*	Fixed bugs:
	*	Fix bug in which links `<http://..>` at beginning of lines could sometimes be mistaken for HTML.
	*	Empty cells in table are now allowed.
	*	Now this is accepted (Maruku did not like the "." inside the link)
	
			[a. b] is a link.
		
			[a. b]: http://site.com/
*	Put back in the trunk changes made by Jacques distler: [REXML fragments][A] and [S5 tweaks][B].
*	Fix bug about double-encoding of ampersands in code blocks.
*	Changes to S5 by Jacques.
*	Changes to `to_latex.rb` by Jacques.

[B]: http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/code/instiki/svn/vendor/plugins/maruku/lib/maruku/output/s5/to_s5.rb

#### Changes in 0.5.7  (October 2007) ####     

*	Fixed compatibility bug with newest Ruby 1.8.6 patchlevel 110. 
	Update if you find this error:
	
		NameError: undefined method `write_children' for class `REXML::Element'

*	Bug fixes:

	*	PDF: Fixed bug with colorbox. 
	*	PDF: Fixed bug for pdf export with `-o`.
	*	Markdown input: corrected a bug in parsing.
		
		This fragment:
		
			* [maruku]: good software.
		
		was not correctly interpreted (it was mistaken as a link definition).

#### Changes in 0.5.6  ####    

*	News:

	-	Now Maruku is in the official Gentoo Portage tree (done by [Aggelos Orfanakos])
	
*	New stuff: 

	- Attribute `maruku_signature` defaults to false. (many people asked this)
	- unittests scripts are included in the distribution.
	- New attribute `filter_html`: if true, raw HTML/XML is discarded. (asked by Marik)
	- Command line: if output file is `-`, Maruku writes to stdout.

*	Bug fixes:

	*	Another tiny bug in HTML parsing.
	*	In latex, `\linebreak` was used instead of `\newline` (reported by Sam Kleinman)
	*	Fixed bug with non-alpha numeric characters in ref.ids (reported by Aggelos Orfanakos)

	
*	Pending bugs/feature requests:

	- Maruku does not allow 3-space indented lists.
	- Lists item whose first character is UTF8 are not recognized (reported by Aggelos Orfanakos)
	- Maruku cannot output `"`-delimited attributes, because `REXML` does not support it.

#### Changes in 0.5.5  ####    

*	Features:

	*	Input of HTML numeric entities:
	
			Examples of numeric character references include &#169; or &#xA9; 
			for the copyright symbol, &#913; or &#x391; for the Greek capital 
			letter alpha, and &#1575; or &#x627; for the Arabic letter alef.

		> for the copyright symbol, &#913; or &#x391; for the Greek capital 
		> letter alpha, and &#1575; or &#x627; for the Arabic letter alef.

*	Bug fixes:
	
	*	Alt text was ignored for images.
	*	Fixed minor bug in reading HTML inside paragraph.
	*	Changed rules for block-level HTML to make it similar to Markdown.pl. 
		For example:
		
			Paragraph
			<div></div>
		
		will be translated to 

			<p>Paragraph
			<div></div></p>
			
		while this:
			
			Paragraph
			
			<div></div>
		
		becomes
		
			<p>Paragraph</p>
		
			<div></div>

*	**Pending bugs**: there are some problems when parsing lists. It is difficult
	to get it right because the spec is very fuzzy. At the moment, list items 
	cannot be indented by more than 1 space.

#### Changes in 0.5.4 ####  

*	Features:

	*	[All HTML attributes](http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/index/attributes.html) are supported. 
	
			>  Science is a wonderful thing if one does not
			>  have to earn one's living at it.
			{: cite="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein"}

	*	Attribute `doc_prefix`.
	
	*	Math:
		
		*	`\begin{equation}` and `\end{equation}` are understood.
		*	Math parsing enabled per-instance using the `math_enabled` attribute.
		*	`math_numbered` attribute.
		
*	Bug fixes:

	*	Runs quietly with `ruby -w`.
	*	Fixed a bug which could cause data-loss when reading indented lines.


#### Changes in 0.5.3 ####  

*	Features:

	*	[All HTML `table` attributes](http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/tables.html#h-11.2.1)
		can be used (`summary`, `width`, `frame`, `rules`,
		`border`, `cellspacing`, `cellpadding`).
		
		The next version will hopefully use all HTML attributes.
		

	<!-- A version of Markdown that is more Japanese or something --> 
	
*	Bug fixes:

	*	Crash on this line: (found by Aggelos Orfanakos) 
	
			[test][]:
	
	*	Regression with attribute system (found by Charles)

#### Changes in 0.5.1 ####    

*	Bug fixes:
	
	*	Workaround for Internet Explorer bug: 
		be very sure that `&apos;` is always written as `&#39;`.
		
	*	Support for empty images ref: `![image]` and `![image][]`.

	*	Fixed bug in parsing attribute lists definitions.

*	Minor things:
	
	*	Now code blocks are written as a `<code>` element inside a `<pre>`, and
		`<code>` elements have both `class` and `lang` attributes set 
		to the specified language.
		
		Example:

			    Example
			{:lang=ruby}
		{:lang=markdown}
		
		produces:
		
			<pre><code class='ruby' lang='ruby'>Example</code></pre>
		{:lang=xml}
		
#### Changes in 0.5.0 ####  

*	Syntax changes:

	*	Compatibility with newest Markdown.pl: `[text]` as a synonim of `[text][]`.

	*	Meta data: the first IAL in a span environment now refers to the parent.
		This makes it possible to set attributes for cells:

			Head           |  Head |
			---------------+-------+--
			{:r}  Hello    + ...

			{:r: scope='row'}

		The first cell will have the `scope` attribute set to `row`.

*	New settings:

	*	Disable the Maruku signature by setting `maruku signature: false`

*	Stricter doctype. By the way -- did I mention it? -- 
	**Maruku HTML has always been proper validating XHTML strict** 
	(if a page does not validate, please report it as a bug).

	Of course, this only matters when using `maruku` as a standalone
	program.

	*	I have updated the XHTML DTD used to support MathML: 
		currently using XHTML+MathML+SVG.
	*	Content-type set to `application/xhtml+xml`	
	*	All entities are written as numeric entities.

*	Bug fixes

	*	Many fixes in the code handling the sanitizing of inline HTML.
	*	`markdown=1` did not propagate to children.
	*	LaTeX: An exception was raised if an unknown entity was used.

#### Changes in 0.4.2 ####    

*	Adapted syntax to the [new meta-data proposal][proposal].

*	Changes in LaTeX export: 

	*	Links to external URLs are blue by default.

	*	New attributes: `latex_preamble` to add a custom preamble,
		and `latex_cjk` to add packages for UTF-8 Japanese characters.
		(**support for this is still shaky**). Example:
	
			Title: my document
			LaTeX CJK: true
			LaTeX preamble: preamble.tex
		
			Content

*	Bug fixes

	+ Images were not given `id` or `class` attributes.

	+ Fixed bug in LaTeX export with handling of `<`,`>` enclosed URLs: `<google.com>`.

#### Changes in 0.4.1 aka "Typographer" ####

*	Implemented SmartyPants support:

		'Twas a "test" to 'remember' -- in the '90s 
		--- while I was <<ok>>. She was 6\"12\'.
	> 'Twas a "test" to 'remember' -- in the '90s --- while I was <<ok>>.
	> She was 6\"12\'.

	I adapted the code from RubyPants.
	
*	Server directives between `<? ?>` are properly preserved.
*	Changes in LaTeX export:

	*	Now Japanese text rendering sort of works, using the following packages:

			\usepackage[C40]{fontenc}
			\usepackage[cjkjis]{ucs}
			\usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc}
		
		Nevertheless, I could only get bitmap fonts working -- probably it's a problem
		with my setup.

		A quick test: 日本、中国、ひらがな、カタカナ。

	*	Fixed bugs in rendering of immediate links.
	*	External packages are `require`d only if needed.
	*	More symbols supported.
		See the symbol list 
		[in HTML](http://maruku.rubyforge.org/entity_test.html) and
		[in PDF](http://maruku.rubyforge.org/entity_test.pdf).


#### Changes in 0.4 ####

* First implementation of [the new meta-data syntax][meta].
* General refactorization of the code and much cleaner error reporting.
* Created [the RDOC documentation][rdoc].
* The `add_whitespace` method took too much time -- it was O(n^2).
* Added unit-tests for block-level elements.

#### Changes in 0.3 ####

*	A real parser is used instead of a regexp-based system, also for span-level 
	elements.

	Now Maruku is almost 2x faster than Bluecloth, while having more features.

	Here are some benchmarks:
	
		BlueCloth (to_html): parsing 0.00 sec + rendering 1.54 sec = 1.55 sec 
		Maruku (to_html):    parsing 0.47 sec + rendering 0.38 sec = 0.85 sec 
		Maruku (to_latex):   parsing 0.49 sec + rendering 0.25 sec = 0.73 sec
		
	This is the result of running `lib/maruku/tests/benchmark.rb` on the Markdown 
	specification.

*	Prettier HTML output by adding whitespace.
 
*	Added a full suite of unit-tests for the span-level parser.

*	Error management: Having a real parser, Maruku warns you about syntax issues.
	
	The default action is to warn and try to continue. If you do this:

		Maruku.new(string, {:on_error => :raise})

	then syntax errors will cause an exception to be raised (you can catch this
	and retry).

*	Fixed a series of bugs in handling inline HTML code.

Immediate TODO-list:

*	UTF-8 input/output works OK for HTML, however I am having pain trying to export
	to LaTeX. I want at least Japanese characters support, so if you know how to 
	do this you are very welcome to give me an hand.
	
	For example: in the HTML version, you should see accented characters in this
	parenthesis: 
	
	> (àèìòù)
	
	and Japanese text in these other parentheses: 
	
	> (カタカナで 私の 名前は アンドレア チェンシ です).
	>
	> (日本のガルは 大好き、でも、日本語は難しですから、そうぞ 英語話すガルを おしえてください).
	
	In the LaTeX version, these do not appear. I know how to do LaTeX with 
	ISO-8859-1 encoding (European characters), but I'm struggling with half-baked 
	solutions for UTF-8 encoded documents.

*	Implement the [new meta-data proposal][proposal].

*	Exporting to Markdown (pretty printing).

*	Exporting to HTML splitting in multiple files.

*	RubyPants.

*	Support for images in PDF.
