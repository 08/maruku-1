Logical grouping / DIV syntax for Markdown
==========================================

`+--` starts a div, `---` ends a div (both with no indentation):

    +--
      Inside a div..
    ---

These two can be nested:

    +--
    Inside first DIV
    +--
     DIV inside DIV
    ---
    ---

Attribute lists can be put after `+--` or after `---`:

    +--                           {.warning}
    This is a Warning!
    ---

    +--
    Second Warning!
    ---                           {.warning}

Compressed syntax: if the first line after `+--` begins with `|`,
the content of the DIV is

    +--                           {.warning}
    | third warning!

Visual candy can be added easily:

    +-----------------------------------{.warning}------
    | this is the last warning!
    |
    | please, go away!
    |
    |+------------------------------------- {.menace} --
    || or else terrible things will happen
    ||--------------------------------------------------
    |---------------------------------------------------

this translates to:

    <div class="warning">
      <p>this is the last warning!</p>
      <p>please, go away!</p>
      <div class="menace">
      <p>or else terrible things will happen</p>
      </div>
    </div>
