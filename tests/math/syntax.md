LaTeX preamble: preamble.tex

You have to have one non-space character after
the first `$` and one non-space character before the last `$`.

For example, these are not math: $20,000 and $30,000,
nor these: $20,000 $, but this *is* math: $20,000$.

Stop talking about money -- here are some formulas:

*	$\alpha$
*	$x^{n}+y^{n} \neq z^{n}$

Some inline maths: $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{n} = \ln 2$. 

Some display  maths:

\[ \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n} \text{ is divergent, but } \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{i} - \ln n \text{ exists.} \]     (1)

Some random AMSTeX symbols - thanks to Robin Snader for adding these:

Note that $\hat g$ , $J$, and $\gamma_1\gamma_2$ all restrict to

$x_1 \overline{x_2} \oplus x_2 \overline{x_1}$ and that this module
is linear in $x_1$ and $x_2$.
